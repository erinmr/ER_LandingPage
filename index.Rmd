I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the [Information Science Program](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience). I work in the Palen Lab and am advised by [Dr. Leysia Palen](https://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/). I am focused on information infrastructure as it supports scientific collaboration. I have two primary research projects, [FAIR Island](https://www.fairisland.org/) and [NASA Openscapes Frameworks](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/).
